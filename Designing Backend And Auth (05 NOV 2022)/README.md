## ðŸ”· **dotenv**
The dotenv(.env) package is a great way to keep password, API keys and other sensitive data out from your code.
Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.

## ðŸ”· **Business Logic**
 Business Logic is the layer that decides what should happend to the data that is sent to the database or sent out of th database.

## ðŸ”· **Model**
Model is the folder location where we define the format of collections that we store in the mongodb database.

## ðŸ”¹Reason for `npm i -D nodemon`
If you do it without -D devdependencies then it will get installed as a regular dependency and will be bundled together with your production app increasing the size and adding unnecessary dependency.

### Devdependencies like `nodemon` we don't want to package for final build of the application (only for development purpose on local)

## ðŸ”¹ What is `package-lock.json`
It holds the exact snapshot version, link from where the package is downloaded and hash value to verify this is a valid package that is getting installed.

## ðŸ”¹ Tips for dotenv .env file 
- We always write in Capital letters PORT = 4000
- Atleast once we have to bring `.env` inside app.js
- Bring `.env` before `express` because the PORT need to get loaded first and then on that PORT you will be able to run.
- Dont put `(;)` semicolumn inside `.env` file.
- `process.env.PORT` it is internally this `const {PORT} = process.env`
- ```require ('dotenv).config() ``` config() loads `.env` file contents into `process.env`

- Config({abc}) if there something is passed in this then your `.env` is not in the root directory, it is kept somewhere else.

## ðŸ”¹ `require` vs `import`
Because node.js does not support ES6 syntax out of the box. It uses common js syntax and hence we use require to import
